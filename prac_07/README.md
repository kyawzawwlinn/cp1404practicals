# CP1404 Practicals

## Introduction
Welcome to the CP1404 Practicals repository! This repository contains the practical exercises and projects completed during the CP1404 Programming II subject. Here, you'll find code implementations, solutions, and other relevant materials related to the practical assignments.

## About the Author
I am Kyaw Zaww Linn, a student enrolled in the CP1404 Programming II subject. This repository serves as a record of my progress and understanding of the concepts covered throughout the course.

## Lessons Learned about Clean Code
In the process of working on this practicals repository, I have gained valuable insights into writing clean and maintainable code. Here are three main lessons I have learned:

- **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Adopting consistent and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes enhances code readability and makes it easier for others (and future me) to understand the code.

- **Modularization and Code Organization:** Breaking down complex problems into smaller, modular components promotes code reusability and simplifies debugging. Properly organizing code into functions and classes improves overall code structure.

- **Documentation and Comments:** Clear and concise documentation, along with well-placed comments, is essential for understanding the purpose and functionality of the code. This practice facilitates collaboration and helps maintain the codebase over time.
