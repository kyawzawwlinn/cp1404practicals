# Reflections on Practical Tasks

## Estimates Accuracy
In the beginning, my estimates for the practical tasks were not very accurate. I often either underestimated or overestimated the time and effort required. However, as the course progressed, I noticed a significant improvement in my ability to estimate more accurately. This improvement was largely due to my growing understanding of the tasks and my increasing familiarity with the tools and languages being used.

## Learning from Code Reviews
### Being Reviewed
Being on the receiving end of code reviews has been immensely educational. It has helped me understand the importance of writing clean, readable code and has often brought to my attention aspects of coding I hadn't considered, such as optimization and best practices.

### Conducting Reviews
Conducting code reviews for my peers was equally enlightening. It forced me to critically analyze code, deepening my understanding of the language and logic. Additionally, it taught me to provide constructive feedback, balancing critique with encouragement.

## Changes to the Practical Tasks
If I were in charge of the subject, I would suggest the following changes to the practical tasks:
1. **More Collaborative Projects:** Encouraging more group-based projects can enhance learning through peer interaction.
2. **Variety in Task Types:** Incorporating a broader range of tasks that cater to different aspects of programming, such as debugging challenges or performance optimization tasks.

## Code Reviews
Here are links to two Pull Requests (PRs) where I conducted code reviews that I am particularly proud of:

1. https://github.com/kyawzawwlinn/cp1404practicals/pull/3
2. https://github.com/kyawzawwlinn/cp1404practicals/pull/4

Each of these reviews was an opportunity for me to apply my learning.
